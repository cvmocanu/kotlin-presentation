    - "This design decision is based on the practice of using checked exceptions in Java. Experience has shown that the Java rules often requires a lot of meaningless code to rethrow or ignore the exceptions, and the rules don't consistently protect you from the errors that can happen" (Kotlin in Action, page 40)
    - you can still mention them in KDoc (javadoc for Kotlin, markdown syntax)
